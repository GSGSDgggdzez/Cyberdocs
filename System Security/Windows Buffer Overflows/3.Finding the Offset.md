# Finding the Offset

> Offset: It's finding at what moment we can correctly crash the program

It's finding exactly where we overwrite the EIP

we use the number found during fuzzing

```sh
msf-pattern_create l {3000}
```

This will generate random characters that we will use in the file (`offset.py`)

We execute then we retrieve the EIP address to find the offset

```sh
msf-pattern_offset -l {3000} -q {386F4337}
```

This returns an offset that will allow us to control the EIP
