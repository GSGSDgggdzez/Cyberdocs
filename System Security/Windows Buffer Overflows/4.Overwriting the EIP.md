# Overwriting the EIP

We use the value returned by the offset

```sh
msf-pattern_offset -l 3000 -q {386F4337}
```

=> 2003

> So we have 2003 bytes before reaching the EIP and the EIP itself is 4 bytes long

so we need 2003 bytes to reach the EIP and 2003 makes (4 bytes)

> So we will try to overwrite those 4 bytes specifically.

"A" * 2003 + "B" * 4
so B - 4 is the EIP we control and B in ASCII is: 42424242
if the EIP has this value then we have succeeded in overwriting the EIP and we control it completely
