> Spiking: These are methods used to search for a type of vulnerability in our programs or a vulnerable part of a program. 

NB: The vulnerable server is running and Immunity too

* All commands are entry points for BOF, we test them one by one and see which one breaks.

* Focus on the TRUN command.

```sh
