**Extensions:**

Install extensions that block or reduce the amount of information that websites get about you:

- `User Agent Switcher and Manager`: Spoofs your browser's User Agent string to a custom designation.

- `No script`: Allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to run only by trusted websites of your choice

- `Privacy Badger`: Prevents advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you view on the Web

- `Unlock Origin`: Filters ad display requests and prevents your browser from fetching and displaying marketing content.

- `Automatic deletion of cookies`: Automatically delete unwanted cookies from your closed tabs while keeping the ones you want.

**Sock Puppets:**

The best way to separate your real person from your digital person is to use the [Sock Puppets](./Sock%20Puppets.md) tools.
