Basic operations: 

```sh
!                               # NOT
||                          	# OR
&&                              # AND
!= 	                            # diff
(=, >, <, <=, >=, !=, LIKE) 	# Comparison
; 	                            # end
/                               # Division
*                               # Multiplication
%                               # Modulus 
+                               # Addition 
-                               # Subtraction
```

Comments - Always terminate an SQLi with one of these elements:

```sql
-- -
#
--
--+
//
/*
;-- -
```
