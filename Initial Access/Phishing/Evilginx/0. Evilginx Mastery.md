**Phishing** is a **fraud technique** used by cybercriminals to **trick a person** into **disclosing sensitive information** such as: their login credentials, password, banking information, or other personal data.

The attacker impersonates a trusted entity (bank, company, government, etc...) and sends a message that appears official.
