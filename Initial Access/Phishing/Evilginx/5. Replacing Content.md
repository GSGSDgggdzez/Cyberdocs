Replace the content of certain elements of the fake website. For this, use the `sub_filters` option in the phishlet

- Locate (inspect with the mouse) the element you want to modify and check if it is managed in JS by the application.

```yaml
sub_filters:
  - {triggers_on: 'akira.lab.evilginx.com', orig_sub: 'akira', domain: 'lab.evilginx.com', search: '" Login "', replace: '" Hello world "', mimes: ['text/javascript']}
```
