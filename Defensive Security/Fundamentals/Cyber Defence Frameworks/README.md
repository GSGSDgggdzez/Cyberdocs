# Cyber Defence Frameworks
The framework defines the steps used by adversaries or malicious actors in cyberspace.

To succeed, an adversary must go through all phases of the **Kill Chain**.

> A "Kill Chain" refers to the different stages of an attack.

> In the field of cybersecurity, a "Kill Chain" is used to describe the methodology/path used by attackers such as hackers or APTs to approach and intrude into a target.

## Threat Modeling
This is a series of steps ultimately aimed at improving the security of a system.

1. Identify which systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment.

2. Assess the vulnerabilities and weaknesses that these systems and applications may present and how they could potentially be exploited

3. Create an action plan to secure these systems and applications against the highlighted vulnerabilities

4. Implement policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from recurring.
