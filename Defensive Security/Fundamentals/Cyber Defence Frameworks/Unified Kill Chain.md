# Unified Kill Chain

![](Images/ukc.png)

The UKC states that an attack has 18 phases: from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and understanding the attacker's motivations.

Some phases are very similar to the [Cyber Kill Chain](Cyber%20Kill%20Chain.md)

| **Advantages of the Unified Kill Chain (UKC) Framework**                                                                                          |

| Modern (released in 2017, updated in 2022).                                                        |
| The UKC is extremely detailed (18 phases).                                                      |
| The UKC covers the entirety of an attack, from reconnaissance to exploitation and post-exploitation, and includes identifying the attacker's motivation.                                                        |
| The UKC highlights a much more realistic attack scenario. Various stages will often repeat. For example, after exploiting a machine, an attacker will begin reconnaissance to pivot to another system. |


## Phase 1: In (Initial Foothold)
- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Social Engineering
- Exploitation
- Persistence
- Defence Evasion
- Command & control
- Pivoting

## Phase 2: Through (Network Propagation)
- Discovery
- Privilege Escalation
- Execution
- Credential Access
- Lateral Movement

## Phase 3: Out (Actions on Objectives)
- Collection
- Exfiltration
- Impact
- Objectives
