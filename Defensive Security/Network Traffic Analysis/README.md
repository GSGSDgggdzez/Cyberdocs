# Network Traffic Analysis

- `Layers 1 to 4` of the OSI model focus on controlling data transport between hosts, which includes everything from the physical media used for transmission.

- `Layers 5 to 7` handle the interpretation, management and presentation of encapsulated data presented to the end user.

Consider the OSI model as the theory on which everything works, while the TCP-IP model is more closely aligned with actual network functionality.

**PDU Packet Breakdown**

A PDU is a data packet composed of control information and encapsulated data from each layer of the OSI model.
