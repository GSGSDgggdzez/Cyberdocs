> If we have access to `172.16.0.5` a Windows server and a web server is running on `192.168.45.138:80` we could use this command to create a link to the server `192.168.45.138`

Works like SSH local connections and don't forget to configure samba.

```sh
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8000 listenaddress=172.16.0.5 connectport=80 connectaddress=192.168.45.138
```

```sh
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="forward_port_rule" protocol=TCP dir=in localip=172.16.0.5 localport=8000 action=allow
```

Now from our kali we can navigate to `172.16.0.5:8000` to access the internal server at `192.168.45.138:80`
