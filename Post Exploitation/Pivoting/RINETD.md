# Port Redirection

During an engagement we have root internet access to `Linux Web server (kali)`
We managed to get ssh access to a `Linux Client` in the internal network.

`Linux Web server (kali)` can access the internet but `Linux Client` cannot

On kali:

```sh
sudo apt install rinetd -y
```

```sh
sudo nano /etc/rinetd.conf



# forwarding rules come here
# bindadress 	bindport	connectaddress connectport
0.0.0.0 80 google-ip-dns 80
```

```sh
sudo service rinetd restart
```


On the target linux client:

```sh
ssh target@linux-client
```

```
nc -nvv kali-ip 80
```

This will redirect the connection to google-ip-dns
