Check the ARP cache of the machine (Windows and Linux). Will show all IP addresses of hosts the target has recently interacted with

```sh
arp -a
```

Check static mappings

```sh
# Windows
type C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

# Linux
cat /etc/hosts
```

Check DNS servers for an interface:

```sh
 # Windows
ifconfig /all

# Alternative to reading the resolv.conf file (cat /etc/resolv.conf)
nmcli dev show 
```

Ping Sweep

```sh
for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done
```

Port scanner

```sh
for i in {1..65535}; do (echo > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.1/$i) >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo $i is open; done
```

> It's also worth noting that you may encounter hosts with firewalls blocking ICMP pings (Windows boxes do this frequently).

> However, this will likely pose less of a problem when pivoting, as these firewalls (by default) often only apply to external traffic, meaning that anything sent through a compromised host on the network should be safe. It's worth keeping in mind though.

> If you think a host is active but blocking ICMP ping requests, you can also check some common ports using a tool like netcat.
