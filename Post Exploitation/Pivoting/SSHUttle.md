> It uses an SSH connection to create a tunneled proxy that acts as a new interface. In short, it simulates a VPN, allowing us to route our traffic through the proxy without using proxychains

We can simply connect directly to devices on the target network as we normally would with networked devices.

- The basic command to connect to a server with sshuttle is:

```sh
sshuttle -r username@address SUBNET
```

For example, in our fictional network 172.16.0.x with a compromised server at 172.16.0.5, the command might look like this: `sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24`
> If this worked, you should see the following line: `c : Connected to server.`

- Using key-based authentication:

```sh
sshuttle -r user@address --ssh-cmd "ssh -i KEYFILE" SUBNET
```

You may encounter an error that looks like this:

```md
client: Connected.  
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe  
client: fatal: server died with error code 255
```

This can happen when the compromised machine you're connecting to is part of the subnet you're trying to access.

For example, if we're connecting to 172.16.0.5 and trying to forward 172.16.0.0/24, we would include the compromised server in the newly forwarded subnet, disrupting the connection and causing the tool to die.

To work around this issue, we tell sshuttle to exclude the compromised server from the subnet range using the `-x` switch:

```sh
sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24 -x 172.16.0.5
```
