**Pivoting**: is the art of using access gained on one machine to exploit another machine deeper in the network.

There are two main methods encompassed in this area of pentesting:

- **Tunnelling/Proxying**: creating a proxy-like connection through a compromised machine in order to route all desired traffic to the targeted network. 
 This could also be tunneled inside another protocol (e.g., SSH tunneling), which can be useful for evading an intrusion detection system (IDS) or a basic firewall.

- **Port Forwarding**: creating a connection between a local port and a single port on a target, through a compromised host

> A proxy is good if we want to redirect many different types of traffic to our target network for example, with an nmap scan or to access multiple ports on multiple different machines.

> Port forwarding tends to be faster and more reliable, but only allows us to access a single port (or a small range) on a target device.

As a general rule, if you have multiple possible entry points, try to use a Linux/Unix target where possible, as it's generally easier to pivot from these. An externally-facing Linux web server is absolutely ideal.

**Always start by: [Enumerating the target network](./Enumeration.md)**

**Tools**:
