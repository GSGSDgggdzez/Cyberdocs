HTTPTunneling Through Deep Packet Inspection

```sh
sudo apt install -y httptunnel
```

> If we have root ssh access to `172.16.0.5` a linux server with the `Deep Packet Content Inspection Feature` implemented and only allows HTTP protocol. In this scenario an SSH tunnel will not work. Additionally the firewall allows ports 80, 443 and 1234 `In-Band` and `Out-Band`.
 >
> We want to access the RDP service running on a windows at `192.168.45.138:3389` from our kali going through the compromised linux server using **only the HTTP protocol**
>
> KALI -> LINUX_SERVER -> RDP-WINDOWS => HTTP

Step 1

```sh
# Linux
ssh -L 0.0.0.0:8888:192.168.45.138:3389 user@127.0.0.1
```

```sh
# Linux
hts --forward-port localhost:8888 1234
```

Step 2

```sh
# KALI
htc --forward-port 8080 172.16.0.5:1234
```

```sh
# KALI 
rdesktop 127.0.0.1:8080
```
